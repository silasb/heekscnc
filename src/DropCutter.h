// Dan Heeks said:
//	Anders,
//    I have copied your DropCutter.cs for calculating the Z height from triangles.
//    I would like to use this in an open source project, but using a more permissive license than you.
//    The files I have made, derived from yours, are DropCutter.h and DropCutter.cpp, I have attached them.
//    I had to add tolerances to the tests.
//    Please can you give me permission to use this copy and release it under a BSD license?
//
// Anders Wallin said:
// yes, you are free to release this under the BSD license if you want. As someone pointed out on my blog the edge-test for the toroidal cutter is wrong, or at least only an approximation to the exact geometry
